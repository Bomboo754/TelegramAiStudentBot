# TelegramAiStudentBot
Telegram Bot prototype for my school project

# **A simple Telegram bot that helps students explore topics independently — no direct answers, only questions and resources.**

> **"Learn, Create & Grow"** — with curiosity as the engine.

---

## What It Does?

1. Student types a topic (e.g. `space`)
2. Bot asks **2–3 open-ended questions**
3. Provides **1–2 free resources** (YouTube, Khan Academy, etc.)
4. **Never gives answers** — encourages critical thinking

---

## Why It Matters?

| Problem | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Students are bored with memorization | Sparks **curiosity** through exploration |
| Lack of access to good materials | Gives **direct links** to quality content |
| AI gives answers → no learning | Bot **only asks questions** |
